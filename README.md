Hi! My name is Liam Hyde and I'm a graduating senior from Cal Poly's Noyce school of computer science. This is the github for my senior project, an AWS Lambda API that takes in a github url and returns a link to a generated UML diagram uploaded to S3. If you want to try it out, I made a frontend here https://lihydeseniorprojectdemo.vercel.app/. I also have made a github workflow using this that runs every time a pull request is closed and comments the updated UML diagram on the pull request, if you want to try it out email me at liamhyde02@gmail.com.
